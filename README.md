# **NUSPasarMalam**
## Orbital 2023

#### Purpose:
- A platform where students are able to list items they would like to sell and request for items they may need urgently
- Making it convinient for students who stay in NUS Campuses to sell and request for items due to their busy schedules, inability to afford the time to travel to different parts of Singapore or unwillingness to pay the extra $3 for tracked mailing
- Allows transactions to be done at flexible timings - before class or in the middle of the night

### Scope of Project
**Mobile Application:**
- Used of [React Native library](https://github.com/facebook/react-native) to create the bulk of the application
- Google Firestore is used as the backend of the project  

**Web Application (Work-in-Progress):**
- Has the same functionality as the mobile application, but allowing users to access it using a web browser
- It will tap on the same backend  

**Telegram Bot (Work-in-Progress):**
- Will send broadcast messages when a new listing or request has been made

### Features of Application
1. Allow sellers to list their items (together with a picture, short description, price and category)
2. Allow sellers to search for requests made by prospective buyers on the platform
3. Allow buyers to filter listings based on factors such as location, price and category
4. Allow buyers to list their requests if there are no listings for a specific item
5. Allow buyers to search for listings on the platform
6. Allow buyers to ‘like’ specific listings to help the listing boost its prominence on the platform
7. Allow a messenging service between potential buyers and sellers
8. Allow both buyers and sellers to receive a push notification when there is an update to their listings or requests
